We are not funding small proposals and only university work. It has to be combined with a company that provides money too. I assume that is not the case in your friends case?! 
So this funding won’t be suitable.

I got a message from Martin (from ICDD) to ask you guys if you would be willing to (and have time) meet the Indian General Consulate on the 6th of June, who is visiting our university and has special interests to meet Indian students. 

Also, please forward this message to other Indian students in and around Witzenhausen who might be interested too. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

thanx,
Devanshi

P.S. The venue would be decided depending on the number of students who would like to participate.

[19/06/19, 1:06:37 PM] Jhenkhar tiff: Most of the times I have seen people asking just about how to get a job and what are do's and dont's but hardly someone asks about what happens after you get a job :)

Few things I would like to share--- the most important thing after getting a job in Germany is the probation period. Unlike India the standard duration here for probation is 6 months. Why so long? 

In Germany the rules are more employee friendly than employer, so the employers always wants to test the employee's potential completely before clearing his/her probation period. Because once you clear the probation period then it is very tough for the employer to fire you as they have to give a very solid reason as why they are asking you to leave but in probation the employer can give you a 2 weeks notice and ask you to leave without any reason. Same is applicable to the employee, and he can leave the organisation after giving a 2 weeks notice to the organisation during probation.

So getting a job does not mean that now you are permanent and company cannot fire you. So many people are asked to leave during the probation. My advice is 

1. When you get the job, respect it and do your job honestly.

2. Dont try too hard to prove yourself and just focus on learning. The only thing that a company expects from you in first 6 months is learning.

3. Socialize with people and try to gel up with the team.

4. Understand the work, Dont focus only on how to but also on why we are doing this.

Also never write things on resume which you dont know, you might clear the interview as people here trust you believing that what you have written in the resume are things which you know already know but if you lie then eventually they will come to know in first 6 months. 

So, when you are preparing for the interview and looking for a job also keeps these things in mind. Trust me the company always wants to keep you with them and will try to find all the positives in you because it cost them time and money to get a resource.

Remember, getting a job is not the end of task, its a start for you to prove yourself of what you committed during the interview:)

Good luck

Cheers!

Saurav

This is to thank you for the kind   help,  care and great company you all gave during my stay here at Germany.
I so much wanted to have a get-together with all of you sometime but that could not happen owing to my prolonged trip to Estonia to see my daughter and to a few places from there.
I am returning to India on 10th and hence will miss you all.
In any case hope to see you all again soon some time.
Wish you all a very good luck in your academics and a happy stay at Germany.
Regards
Ganeshaiah

[02/08/19, 2:53:35 PM] G Supriyaji: May be we can give a coupon where they can buy from multiple shops what they want .
[02/08/19, 2:54:49 PM] Jhenkhar tiff: Istu astu anta ella ankolodu beda ansuttae ( bcz coupn alli price iruttae)
[02/08/19, 2:56:28 PM] G Supriyaji: If everyone puts around 10 euros it will amount to 100 euros .
[02/08/19, 2:56:36 PM] G Supriyaji: I think it’s a decent amount
[02/08/19, 2:57:07 PM] G Supriyaji: If you give play things
[02/08/19, 2:57:13 PM] G Supriyaji: They can’t carry to India
[02/08/19, 2:57:30 PM] G Supriyaji: Left to majority’s opinion

[02/08/19, 2:59:55 PM] G Supriyaji: You get the coupon from shops also here. Any coupon is fine
[02/08/19, 3:00:04 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: Oho

[02/08/19, 3:00:33 PM] Jhenkhar tiff: Hahaha. 😝 My opinion is: giving coupn is not a good idea. She can play 2 months. Carrying to india or etc they can see later.
[02/08/19, 3:01:20 PM] G Supriyaji: We will keep you in side ivaga. Now we are 2 😬

I would like to request you all to sum up a reasonable amount of contribution for Karnataka Flood Relief fund. Or..you guys can send me the amount and I will send that to my friend , who runs a foundation and currently, providing necessary materials for the flood affected people. I think our little contribution would help those people in one or the other ways. We can ask him buy some cloths or necessary medicines. Please let me know your suggestions.

[12/10/19, 11:00:52 AM] Jhenkhar tiff: Any update on bomb evacuation?
[12/10/19, 11:21:06 AM] Jhenkhar tiff: The most important information at a glance
 where can I inform myself?
 Live ticker: In this live ticker we inform you regularly about the current status.  On Saturday, October 12, he will be cared for until the end of the measure.
 Messenger: The messenger service of the city administration informs about the most important messages via Telegram and WhatsApp.
 Info-Hotline: The Info-Hotline on +49 (0) 551/7075100 will be on Friday, October 11th, from 8 am to 6 pm and on Saturday from 6 am until the end of the action.
 Apps: The alert app KATWARN (Android, iOS) informs you about the most important evacuation messages.
 Flyer: Multi-lingual flyer for the evacuation and the possible bomb disposal can be found here.
 Where can I go / Where are the evacuation centers?

 Canteen of the Geschwister-Scholl Comprehensive School: The cafeteria is for those affected who live west of the railway line.  For a full board is taken care of.  Pet are allowed.  The address: Kurt-Huber-Weg 1-5.
 Mensa of the University Hospital Göttingen: Affected people east of the train tracks can visit this cafeteria.  For a full board is taken care of.  Pets are not allowed.  The address: Robert-Koch-Straße 40.
 How do I get to the evacuation centers?

 A bus special service serves the existing stops in the restricted area from 7.00 clock and goes directly to the evacuation centers.
 In the case of reduced mobility: If you are dependent on a transport, you can contact the Info-Hotline on 0551/7075100.
 For local residents with pets east of the railway tracks, trips from the alternative stop Klinikum to the Geschwister-Scholl comprehensive school are organized if required.
 Which area is evacuated?

 The city council has published a detailed map as well as a list of areas, streets and house numbers.  The evacuation area extends over a radius of 1,000 meters to Schützenanger.
 What about local and long-distance traffic?

 The bus network of the Göttinger Verkehrsbetriebe has a two-stage emergency timetable.  As previously communicated, the bus traffic between 11.00 and 13.00 clock must not be set.  This was announced by GoeVB.
 The eviction also affects regional traffic, Deutsche Bahn, metronome, cantus and the Nordwestbahn.
 Evacuation ends / investigation is delayed
 10:58
 12.10.2019 The evacuation area has been cleared.  The ordnance disposal service can not start with the investigation of the suspected bomb yet, because just disturbers impede the evacuation.
 Helicopter of the police starts
 10:12
 12.10.2019 A helicopter of the police is about to start, routinely leaving the evacuation area.
 Evacuation is on schedule
 10:08
 12.10.2019 The evacuation is currently on schedule: more than 70 percent of the inhabitants west of the railways have been evacuated.  As soon as more current figures are available, they will be published here.
 Evacuation area is blocked
 09:10
 12.10.2019 One more hint: It must not be gone or driven to the evacuation area anymore.
 Evacuation is in full swing
 08:43
 12.10.2019 In the evacuation zone, the emergency services go straight from door to door for the residents because of the necessary eviction, which started at 7:00.

 The sooner the area is completely cleared, the sooner the ordnance disposal service can begin investigating the suspected bomb.
 What is an acid igniter?
 08:38
 12.10.2019 An acid detonator is a long-term detonator.  These were used during the Second World War to hinder firefighting and salvage work, since a detonation even hours later is possible.  In the case of dudgers, acid igniters are particularly dangerous, as the igniter can be activated at any time, even today, by changing the position.

 How does the detonator work?
 In an acid igniter, a firing pin is held by a cellulose layer.  A glass ampoule containing acetone is destroyed when the bomb hits.  As a result, the acetone is released and can dissolve the cellulose layer: This releases the impact force of the bolt, the bomb explodes.

 If the ordnance disposal service determines that it is an acidic bomb, a controlled detonation is likely.  This investigation can not take place until the entire area has been evacuated.

 08:07
 12.10.2019 The Göttingen train station is evacuated.
 When can defusing be started?
 07:30
 12.10.2019 The bomb is still under the ground.  Upon completion of the evacuation, the ordnance disposal service may further investigate the location.  The evacuation of the area started at 7:00.  If it is a bomb, it is decided whether to defuse it or if it needs to be blown up.  If the firing mechanism is an acid detonator, blasting is likely and preparations will be made.
 We will report live from now on
 06:35
 12.10.2019 From now on we report live from the staff room of the fire brigade.  There are currently around 700 emergency services on the way, to allow the evacuation from 7:00 clock.
 Bus service is not set for two hours on Saturday
 18:02
 10.10.2019 Differently than on Thursday, 10. October 2019 reported, the bus traffic is stopped because of a demo.

 Update, 11.10.2019: Message updated
[12/10/19, 11:21:31 AM] Jhenkhar tiff: Read from below. If you are interested about updates on evacuation
[12/10/19, 4:07:28 PM] Jhenkhar tiff: all-clear
 After a thorough investigation, the ordnance disposal service fortunately can give the all-clear.  The object is not a bomb, contrary to the first investigation.  The shut-off area is canceled.  From now on residents can return to their apartments and houses.

[28/01/20, 1:03:56 PM] Sharath S P: *Most Urgent,Very Serious, Important information*📣

*Ministry of health’s emergency notification to the public that the Coronavirus influenza outbreak this time is very very serious & fatal. There's no cure once you are infected.*
*Its spreading from China to various countries*

*Prevention method is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within 10 mins.*
*Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age.* *Everytime u feel your throat is dry, do not wait, keep water in hand.* *Do not drink plenty at one time as it doesn’t help, instead continue to keep throat moist.*
*Till end of March 2020, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train or public transportation* *Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.*
*The symptoms/ description are*
*1.repeated high fever*
*2.prolonged coughing after fever*
*3.Children are prone*
*4.Adults usually feel uneasy,*headache and mainly respiratory related*
*5: highly contagious*🚨
Pls share if you care for human life!🙏😇

[09/02/20, 6:08:38 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: And..only the Important Team members who have worked for the mission are allowed to the place of launch ...that’s the usual tradition😊
[09/02/20, 6:09:31 PM] ‪+91 97313 72299‬: Ahhhh

[09/02/20, 6:18:16 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: ✌✌Sure...Our group is also one of the first groups to write research papers using the first data set of Solar Orbiter Mission. It’s a very unique telescope because of its orbit around Sun can capture the north and south poles for the first time with the best resolution imagers. So..I’m sure this mission will significantly improve our understanding of Space weather, Sun-Earth Relationship and High Energetic phenomenons in Space..😊
[09/02/20, 6:19:23 PM] ‪+91 97313 72299‬: Inspiring.

[09/02/20, 6:20:10 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: This mission contains in total 10 instruments
[09/02/20, 6:20:21 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: One of the instruments is from MPS
[09/02/20, 6:20:40 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: It’s a multiple payload mission
[09/02/20, 6:23:02 PM] ‪+91 97313 72299‬: Great. Can you send links of research papers ?
[09/02/20, 6:25:36 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: Now it’s just some of the instrumentation papers ..not interesting..once the mission starts its first orbit around the Sun we get data..afterwards the lead groups write papers ..have to wait for some time ..😊
[09/02/20, 6:27:59 PM] ‪+91 97313 72299‬: Other research papers related to it ?
[09/02/20, 6:30:24 PM] Dinesh Hegade Svg: Before the launch of the mission no science papers can be written on that mission’s data..we have to wait until it send the data back home ..now there are some simulation papers and they are not new findings.😊

[13/03/20, 7:47:41 PM] Jhenkhar tiff: Dear Staff and Students,
 
As you all know, the coronavirus pandemic is now having a significant impact on public life, and the University is not exempt.
First of all: the risk of a serious to life-threatening disease caused by the CoV-2 virus is very low, especially for young and healthy people. In contrast to many other viral diseases, children and adolescents are infected just as often, but only rarely fall ill. Even pregnant women are not particularly at risk. However, there are - and at the present time it is not yet possible to say exactly how frequent this will be - in a few cases, serious and life-threatening consequences of the illness, some of which require weeks of intensive medical care. This particularly affects people with pre-existing conditions and older people. This is where the difficulty lies: even at the University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG), a centre of medical excellence, the capacities for such care are limited. The aim of the measures described below is therefore to slow down the spread of the virus as much as possible. This is to keep the number of serious cases occurring simultaneously as low as possible so that the capacity of our intensive care unit is sufficient for care. These measures must now be implemented in order to interrupt the potential chains of infection, even though there are only a few confirmed cases of infection in the district of Göttingen to date (as of 13 March).

The University Management has therefore made a number of decisions working in close cooperation with the UMG, the City of Göttingen and the state of Lower Saxony. As you probably know, the daycare centres and schools will be closed from Monday onwards. The same applies to teaching at our University. However, the University will not be closed completely: research operations and administration will be maintained until further notice, as long as this is reasonable and proportionate.
 
Suspension of teaching and postponement of the start of lectures
Teaching will be suspended with immediate effect. The start of lectures originally scheduled for 14.04.2020 will initially be postponed to 20.04.2020. The decision on a possible further postponement and the extension of the lecture period will depend on the further development of the coronavirus pandemic. The “O-Phasen” will be cancelled. It will be considered to what extent the most important introductory events can be caught up, in parallel with the start of the lecture period.
Of course, solutions will be found so that students are not put at a disadvantage.
 
Virtual teaching
With the suspension of teaching and the postponement of the start of lectures, the question about  possibilities for virtual teaching has come up in many ways. We assume that this will play an increasingly important role. The Service for Digital Teaching and Learning is currently compiling an overview of the various tools available for virtual teaching and their possible applications. This will be expanded and updated as soon as possible and will include links to instructions for the individual tools.
As the current overload of DFN video conferencing systems shows, the situation now places enormous demands on the technical infrastructure. We are therefore trying to develop solutions that can cope with a large number of users and at the same time meet the needs of teachers and students as far as possible. An important factor is to equalize and distribute the load as evenly as possible. We would therefore ask you to use the coming days and weeks to check which form of virtual teaching would be suitable for you and to inform yourself about the current possibilities (https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/622774.html).
 
Examinations and tests
Examinations where students have to attend in person will be suspended with immediate effect. We are working on arrangements to see how we can resume examination services under the current circumstances and are coordinating the specific procedure with the faculties in a timely manner. Here too of course, solutions will be found to ensure that students are not put at a disadvantage.
 
Libraries and learning and study buildings
The use of the University libraries will cease on Monday, 16.03.2020. The SUB in the Central Campus will introduce an extended lending service in the course of the coming week. For the other libraries, a lending operation will also be considered. Appropriate information will be provided as soon as possible.
Please also note the SUB's information on access to electronic journals, databases and e-books (https://www.sub.uni-goettingen.de/en/news/details/access-electronic-journals-databases-and-ebooks-from-home/)
The Learning and Study building (LSG) as well as internship and laboratory rooms will also be closed from Monday, 16.03.2020.
 
Business trips and excursions
With immediate effect, all business trips, excursions and travel on behalf of the University will not be allowed, regardless of the destination, until further notice. In concrete terms, this means that new business trips will no longer be approved, and that business trips that have already been approved may no longer be taken. Should business trips be necessary in justified individual cases, they must be approved by the crisis management team (Krisenstabsleitung) of the University. Please submit a fully justified request to the HR Department.
If costs are incurred as a result of the cancellation of a business trip, a travel allowance will be reimbursed to the amount of the costs incurred for the preparation of the trip.
 
Events
For the time being, there are no events taking place at the University. Exceptions to this rule are the committees and other meetings necessary for the operation of the University. For these meetings we will provide recommendations for running them as soon as possible, but we ask you to take measures to minimize contact, e.g. by choosing larger rooms or by using telephone or video conferencing technology.
 
Canteens and cafeterias
The crisis management team is working in close coordination with the management of the Studentenwerk, the City and the UMG, to ensure that the cafeterias and dining halls find some kind of an arrangement in a timely manner. The goal is to maintain a basic supply and to minimize the risk of infection. Canteens and cafeterias (with the exception of HAWK cafeterias) will remain open for the time being and have taken various measures to take account of this special situation.
 
IT infrastructure and telephone services
We are working in close coordination with the GWDG and the IT service providers for respective areas of the University (student IT, central administration, SUB, UMG) to ensure sufficient IT supply. We assume that the external network bandwidth is sufficient. Individual services (e.g. VPN) will be strengthened as far as is possible. Please check the necessity of a service for yourself before you use it.  With regards to telephone services, additional services will be provided, e.g. to conduct telephone conferences. Handouts for these and other areas will be made available as soon as possible via the information website.
 
Technical building infrastructures
Building management has drawn up individual emergency plans to ensure the operation of all central systems for research, teaching and administration even in the event of the unavailability of some staff (electricity, heating, air-handling, etc.).
 
Sports
The sports facilities will be closed from Monday, 16.03.2020.
 
Emergency plans
The University shall endeavour to ensure that the University's research and administrative operations can be maintained and shall draw up or update its contingency plans for this purpose.
 
Closure of kindergartens and schools
If you are unable to provide care in any other way, you can work from home in consultation with your responsible manager and if mobile-working is not possible, you will be released from work with salary. Details can be found in our FAQs.
 
Mobile working
Mobile working can and should be used in the current situation as a preventative measure to ensure separation between groups of employees and thus prevent simultaneous infection. If you have specific questions, please contact the HR department.
 
We are aware that these decisions will present you with great challenges and that you will have many questions. We therefore ask you to visit our website https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/621808.html on a regular basis. This page is always kept up-to-date by us.
Yours faithfully,

[21/03/20, 4:38:56 AM] Jhenkhar tiff: For all Indians who are registered in Germany with long-term visa and Indians who have a German partner, who got stuck or stranded in India. 

Indians in Berlin

German government is organizing flights to bring preferably Germans and their partners(nationality doesn't matter here) back from India to Germany at the moment. If there are more places available than the German citizens willing to travel back, then people who possess  longterm visa of Germany and  registered in Germany might get a chance to use this program. The partial cost for the flight have to be paid if you use this program to get back to Germany. Following sites are helpful to inform yourself.
https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/ReiseUndSicherheit/reise-und-sicherheitshinweise/reisewarnungen/faq-reisewarnung?openAccordionId=item-2320092-0-panel

https://india.diplo.de/in-de

This program is exclusively only for Germans and Indians with longterm visa already living in Germany. Not for the persons who are going to enter Germany for first time. 

I hope so I could help at least some this way.

Indians in Germany post.
